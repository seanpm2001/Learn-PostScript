% About:
% I decided to make PostScript the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-PostScript) as PostScript is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the PostScript programming language. It only makes sense to PostScript the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
